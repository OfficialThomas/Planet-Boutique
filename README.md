# Planet Boutique
CMPM 121 Assignment 1 (UNITY)

The goal of this assignment is to show my ability to do the following:
- Manipulate the position of an object
- Manipulate the rotation of an object
- Manipulate the scale of an obejct
- Save and load an object state

I decided to use this opportunity with this project to make a small game related to making your own planet, titled Planet Boutique. The player is supposed to use the arrow keys to move their planet from station to station changing the rotation, scale, and color of the planet. Once the player is done making their planet they can view it rotating around a sun, which is supposed to be the conclusion of the game. Players can still return to the boutique, making sure that the save state of the object can still be used.
